        <h1>China joins global effort to ensure COVID vaccine access for all</h1>
        <img src="vaccine.jpg" alt="vaccine">
        <p>
            Imperial College London/Thomas Angus Imperial College London is one of a number of institutions
            worldwide which is working on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

        9 de octubre 2020 | <a href="https://news.un.org/en/news/topic/health">Health</a>
        <p>
            China is among three additional countries to have signed on to a global initiative that aims to
            ensure fair and equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine once developed, the World Health Organization
            (WHO)reported on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The country, together with the Republic of Korea and the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, joined the
            <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax"> COVAX facility</a>
            this week, bringing the total number of participating nations and economies to 171,
            <a href="https://www.who.int/en/">WHO</a> chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced during his
            regular media briefing on the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The world is eagerly anticipating the results of trials of vaccines against
            <a href="https://www.un.org/coronavirus">COVID-19</a> , which are needed for WHO authorization”,
            said Tedros.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Once we have an effective vaccine, we must also use it effectively, and the best way to do that
            is by making sure it’s available to all countries equitably through the COVAX Facility.”
        </p>
        <h2>More countries, greater prospects</h2>
        <p>
            The global mechanism will work to deliver two billion doses by the end of next year. It currently
            has the largest portfolio of potential vaccines, with several in advanced human trials.
        </p>
        <p>
            WHO was asked about the impact of China’s participation.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The more countries that participate in the COVAX Facility, the greater opportunity of being able
            to roll out vaccines as rapidly as possible, as fairly as possible, to reduce the risk of severe
            COVID disease globally”, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, Senior Advisor.
        </p>
        <p>
            He added that details on China’s enrollment “(are) still being worked out”, with specific
            information anticipated early next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notably, both the United States and Russia have not so far signed on.
        </p>
        <h2>A sign of solidarity </h2>
        <p>
            WHO has also welcomed the announcement this week that vaccine developer Moderna will not enforce
            patent rights over its COVID-19 shots during the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tedros expressed appreciation for “this act of solidarity”, which aligns with another initiative
            for sharing scientific knowledge, data and intellectual property in efforts to beat back the
            disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 Technology Access Pool
            (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-
                novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool">C-TAP</a> ) was launched in May and
            is described as a “one-stop shop” for affordable access to technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            It draws on existing mechanisms such as the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which expands
            access to treatments for HIV and hepatitis for low and middle income countries.
        </p>
        <h2>Praise for the World Food Programme</h2>
        <p>
            Tedros began the briefing by congratulating sister UN agency the World Food Programme (
            <a href="https://www.wfp.org/">WFP</a> ), which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize earlier
            on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
            His praise was echoed by Dr. Michael Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme,
            who has worked in conflict areas and led many responses to epidemics, including containing Ebola in
            the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
        </p>
        <p>
            “WFP not only feeds the hungry but moves most of the humanitarian workforce into the most extreme
            of environments,” Dr.Ryan told journalists.
        </p>
        <p>
            “WFP feeds and protects us in the field and allows us to do our job. We used to say this in West
            Africa, and I will say it to the world: WFP rocks”.

                The UN World Food Programme (WFP), which provides lifesaving food assistance to millions across
                the world – often in extremely dangerous and hard-to-access conditions – has been awarded the  
                2020 Nobel Peace Prize.

        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that “our health systems are inadequate”, the UN chief
            told a ministerial meeting on Thursday, citing weak structures and unequal access to healthcare
            as “major reasons” why the coronavirus has killed one million people and infected more than 30 times
            that, globally.
